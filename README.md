# WasteTrack Chatbot Flask

This project is a simple chatbot implemented using Flask, Python, and a model trained with **Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM)** and **Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU)** neural networks. The chatbot interacts with users, processes their input, and generates appropriate responses based on the trained model.
